## Resource Leveling

Resource Leveling (smoothing) has two objectives:

1. To determine the resource requirements so that they will be available at the right time
2. To allow each activity to be scheduled with the smoothest possible transition across resource usage levels.

---

## Rules of Thumb when solving resource leveling problems(f)

1. Activities with the smallest amount of slack
2. Activities with the smallest duration
3. Activities with the lowest activity identification number (e.g. those that start earliest in the WBS)
4. Activities with the most successor tasks
5. Activities requiring the most resources

when array human resource, avoid lots of slack, not longest

## Resource Allocation across multiple projects

---

The main challenge is one of interdependency: Any resource allocation decisions made in one project are likely to have ramifications in other projects.

Some of the more common problems with interdependency among projects:

1. inefficient use of resources
2. resource bottlenecks
3. ripple effects
4. heightened pressure on personnel to multitask

Any system used to optimize the complex problems with multi-project resource allocation has to consider the need, as much as possible, and to minimize the negative effects of the three key factors:

1. Schedule slippage
2. Resource Utilization
3. In-Process Inventory (WIP)

## Resolving Resource Decisions in Multi-project Environments

There are several methods for resolving resource allocation problems:

1. **"First in Line**" or "first come-first served" is the simplest rule of thumb for allocating resources. It is easy to employ, it simply follows the master project calendar. The earliest project gets scheduled first. This method ignores any other important information such as priority, emergency situations, preference due to higher commercial success of other projects. 

2. **Greatest Resource Demand** With this decision rule the project with the highest demand of resources get scheduled first. Then the remaining projects are being examined and scheduled according to their level of resource demand. The logic in this method is that in this way the resource bottlenecks will show up very quickly and it is being used as a starting point for potential additional resource allocation.

3. **Greatest Resource Utilization** Is a variation on the above rule. This rule schedules the project first that uses the most types of resources. E.g. a company wants to run three projects A, B, and C  across a resource pool made up of programmers, system analyst and networking staff. Project A utilizes a lot of programmers. Project B utilizes all three resource types, but much less. Using this rule, a company will prioritize project B above A in order to ensure that all resources are being utilized to the greatest extend.

4. **Minimum Late Finish Time** This rule prioritizes projects on the basis of finish dates. The one with the earliest late finish date will be prioritized. Remember that the late finish date is the latest an activity can finish without compromising the overall critical path. The goal is to examine those project activities that have extra slack time (shown as a later late finish date) and prioritize activities with minimal slack (= early late finish date)

5. **Mathematical Programming**

   The common objectives that such models seek to maximize are:

   1. Minimize total development time for all projects
   2. Minimize resource utilization across all projects
   3. Minimize total lateness across all projects

   â€‹    While mathematical programming is a worthy approach to resolving the constrained resource problem, it tends to be limited due to the complexity of the problem. The large number of variables and the time necessary to generate a sufficiently small set of options.
