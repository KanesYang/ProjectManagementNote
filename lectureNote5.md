### Scope Statement

A Scope statement is the first document produced in the planning phase of a project being managed and should include:

the project objectives

the project deliverables

the project milestones

the project technical requirements

the project limits and exclusions

a signed off approval of a review of the document with the customer

a signed off approval of a review of the document with corporate management

### Work Breakdown Structure

Definition: A work breakdown structure (WBS) is a deliverable oriented grouping of project components that organizes and defines the total scope of the project.

+ The WBS is the project scope broken down into smaller manageable  pieces. 
+ Project managers cannot, in fact nobody can, manage projects. PM's manage pieces of projects.
+ A WBS looks like a company organization chart, particularly one under development and not yet broken down into its lowest levels, but it is not.
+ The WBS is the tool used to decompose a scope to a manageable level.

---

### Characteristics of a WBS

+ Tasks at the lowest level should take between 8 and 80 man*hours to complete.  This is the correct level of detail required for people to manage.
+ The WBS is not a simple list of tasks, that you can then roll into a Gantt chart!
+ A WBS demonstrates the flow of work for a project and allows the team to view it.  A simple list does not.
+ A WBS is the correct illustration for generating stakeholder buy-in for a project.

WBS = best document to communicate with customer

### Rules for Creating a WBS

A WBS is created by the full project team.

The first level is completed before the project is broken down further

Each level of the WBS is a smaller segment of the level above

The entire project is included in each of the higher levels, however eventually some levels will be broken down more than others.

Work toward the project deliverables

Work not included in the WBS, is not part of the project.

Break down the project into work packages that can be realistically and confidently estimated.

Break down the project to a point where it can no longer be logically subdivided, can be completed quickly, and has a meaningful deliverable.

Break down the project into packages that can be completed without interruption. (no additional information required)

### WBS Dictionary - explained

The WBS Dictionary is the Taxonomy for the WBS Activities

Used to control what work is done and when

Used to prevent scope creep

Used to understand the effort for each task

Physically the WBS dictionary is written when the WBS work packages are posted on a wall or white board in a logical sequence relative to one another to reflect the flow of work.  When they are removed in numerical order, the WBS Dictionary is generated

Entries in the dictionary are referred to as task descriptions

Frequently they are arranged on color coded work packages to clearly identify the hierarchy of the task.

### Work Authorization

Once the scope has been decomposed into useful work packages, the next natural step is to get formal agreement between stakeholders regarding project content known as the work authorization.  If the client is external, this likely includes the contract signoff.

Project management contracts to be valid require and consist of at least:   

1. Possessing the legal right to contract   
2. Being of legal age to contract   
3. Being of sound mind at the time of signing   
4.  Valid and Legal Consideration for both parties   
5. A legal scope of work 
6.   Offer and acceptance



Project management contracts also likely contain many of the following:

Excusable delays

Allowable costs

Statements of liquidated damages (non-performance clauses)

Criteria for Inspection

Responsibility for correction of defects

Dispute resolution mechanisms

---

### Scope Reporting

Scope reporting consists of regular updates regarding cost, schedule, and technical performance.  Typical documents include:

+ S-Curves (graphical display of costs vs. project schedule)
+ Earned Value Analysis:  Reports project status in terms of both costs  and time – The budgeted value of work  performed  regardless	of actual costs incurred.
+ Variance or exception reports – documenting any slippages in time, cost, or resources
+ Schedule status:  Updates on schedule adherence
+ Technical performance status:  Updates on technical challenges and solutions

​    The parties receiving these documents could be any stakeholders that need to know.
