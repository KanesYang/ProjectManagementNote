### Steps to Reduce the Critical Path

### Resource Leveling

+ Sometimes it is necessary to make the critical path of the project actually longer!  This technique is called resource leveling.
+ While resource leveling does not by definition mandate lengthening the critical path it almost always does.
+ Resource leveling is carried out when a project resource must be used to address schedule activities that need to be performed to meet specified delivery dates, or to address a situation where shared or critical resources are only available at certain times or in limited quantities.
+ Resource leveling is also used to keep selected resources at constant levels during specific times of the project work.

### Activity Duration Estimating

There are several methods:

+ Expert judgment estimating – Guided by historical information this can be used whenever possible.
+ Analogous estimating – A method of estimating that employs using a similar schedule activity from a previous project as the basis for establishing the likely duration of a future schedule activity.Parametric estimating – the quantity of work multiplied by the productivity rate.  For example labor hours to draw times number of hours, or cable installation in meters of cable times labor hours per meter.
+ Three point method – PERT
+ Reserve analysis estimating – An output of risk analysis, it can be employed to add empty buffers in project timing to deal with risk as part of a contingency plan.

### Lags in Precedence Relationships

There are 4 common logic relationships between tasks:

1. Finish to Start
2.  Finish to Finish
3.  Start to Start
4.  Start to Finish

### Gantt Charts

When they are linked to a project schedule, they can be used to track the progress of the project against it's plan. Some of the benefits of Gantt Charts are:

+ they are easy to read and comprehend
+ they identify the project network coupled with the schedule
+ they allow for updating and project control
+ they are useful for assigning resources to tasks
+ they are also easy to create.

## CRASHING PROJECTS – UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS?

+ The initial schedule may be too optimistic. 
+ Market needs change and the project is in demand earlier than anticipated.  
+ The project has slipped considerably behind schedule. 
+  The contractual situation provides even more incentive to avoid schedule slippage.

### Options for Accelerating Activities

+ Improving the productivity of existing project resources (team meeting to focus efforts on the most important aspect of a task. Review best practice how to do the task.)
+ Changing the working method employed for the activity, usually by altering the technology and types of resources employed (Change from drawing review to CAD model review)
+ Increasing the quantity of project resources, including personnel, plant, and equipment (OT, extra shifts, expedite freight, ...)

### Caution with requesting (excessive) overtime !

There is research that suggests that the greater the amount of overtime workers are expected to perform, the lower the marginal performance a company is likely to receive from them. For example, it was found that in engineering functions, optimal performance was realized after only four hours of overtime per week. By the time engineers were working 10 hrs of overtime, the marginal real extra output realized by the company had dropped to zero!

### Controversies in the use of Networks

PERT/CPM is well understood and much employed, nevertheless networks are an abstract representation of events where time is reduced to a number. They may or may not be drawn to a scale that has a relationship to ongoing patterns or time. There are several caveat we need to keep in mind when we develop project activity networks:

+ Networks can become too large and complex to be meaningful
+ Faulty reasoning in network construction can sometimes lead to oversimplification or incorrect representations.
+ Networks are sometimes used for tasks which they are not well suited
+ Networks used to control the behavior of subcontractors have special dangers.
+ There is a strong potential for positive bias in PERT estimations used in network construction.
