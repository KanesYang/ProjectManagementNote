## The Project Charter: is the document that gives the specific project manager the authority to proceed with the project.

Board of director, VP, director => make charter

+ Sometimes known as the Statement of Work (SOW)
+ A project charter is the document that gives the specific project manager the authority to proceed with the project
+ .A project charter is the document that formally recognizes the existence of a project.
+ A project charter provides the goals and objectives of the project.
+ Every project must have a project charter to be a project.
+ The project charter is the document against which success or failure of the project will be measured.

### Characteristics of all Project Charters(critical path management)

+ Created by a manager or director who is external to the project and higher in the corporate hierarchy.
+ Created during the defining or (as in PMBOK) the initiating phase of the project.
+ Broad enough so that it does not NEED to change as the project changes.
+ An output of scope initiation.
+ Owned and applied by the project manager if and as necessary post executive approval.

### Contents of a Project Charter(important) sometimes executive could not make decision so quickly

+ Project Title and Description (What is the project?)
+ **Project manager assigned and authority level** (Who is given authority to lead the project and to what degree do they have decision making responsibility for cost, resources, and timing – the Triple constraint)
+ **Objectives** (What Triple constraint numerical criteria will be used to measure project success?)
+ **Business Case** (Why is the project being done?)
+ **Product Description and Deliverables** (What are the specific deliverables that are wanted and what will be the end result of the project.)
+ **Signature noting Approval to Proceed** (a person high enough on the organization chart that everyone will indirectly rep

### Supplementary contents also often included

+ The nomination of key technical resources.  This gives the PM the authority to work with specific skilled individuals.
+ A rough pre-released scope statement.
+ The methodology to be applied.  For example it may clearly state PMBOK methodology or perhaps the home grown modified PMBOK methods a company may apply.  If so it usually has a name and it should be stated.
+ The portfolio alignment the project will be a part of.  This would then mandate the project to be monitored for consistent content with a particular family of other programs and projects that the company has either completed or will complete.

## Discussion Exercise

**Case**: An aviation electronics manufacturing firm requests the design and execution of an experiment (DOE) to determine the influences of various system parameters upon the solderability of their surface mount devices on a printed circuit board they manufacture.  The project is to be contractually assigned to the company you work for as a project manager.  Based upon the DOE results, the project is to also include system upgrades as necessary to achieve their 6 sigma process control targets for soldering.



1. Write out the project charter making up relevant details as necessary.
2. What special charter considerations should be made for the execution of corrections identified by the DOE?  Should more than 1 charter be issued in this case? Why?
3. Should the cost of quality be considered in this case?  How? Can the charter be issued without making this consideration? 
4. As the project is contractual, is a charter necessary?

## Question to the Class

You have created the project charter, but could not get it approved.  Your manager and his boss have asked that the project begin immediately.  Which of the following is the BEST thing to do:

1. Set up an integrated change control process
2. Show your manager the impact of proceeding without approval
3. Focus on completing projects that have a signed charter
4. Start work only on the critical path tasks.

Answer:   **B**   The best thing to do would be to evaluate the impact.   This is the only choice that prevents future problems - always the best choice.  The other choices just pretend the problem does not exist.

## *<u>**(important) Scope Creep**</u>*



“**<u>*Scope Creep*</u>** in project management refers to uncontrolled changes in a project’s scope.



Typically, the scope increases by adding both new products and new features of already approved products. As a result, the project drifts away from its original purpose. Because of the tendency to look at only one dimension of a project, scope creep can also result in a project overrunning its original budget and schedule, as more is to be done at the same cost and in the same time (which is usually unrealistic, given a stretched original budget and schedule).

Scope creep can be a result of: 

1. poor change control  

2. lack of proper identification what products and features are required to bring about the achievement of project objectives in the first place.  

3. weak project manager or executive sponsor"
