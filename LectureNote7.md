### Earned Value Analysis

Earned Value Analysis is a point in time technique used for tracking project progress thus far.  It is also a great tool for predicting the performance of the project moving forward.

Fundamentally the concept is simple.  " What have we spent so far, and what are the value of goods and services we have received in return so far"?

Usually it is very simple for the project manager to calculate this.  He adds up his purchase orders to vendors + his expenses – these are his actual costs, and he compares them to what he received in return – this is his earned value.

Your first instinct upon reading that last note should be " But the project manager should always get exactly what he pays for!!"  Yes that is true, but what he gets does not always solve the problem it was intended to solve or to the degree that was desired.  So, some estimating of earned value is usually required.  It is generally done by estimating the percent complete for each individual work breakdown package and summing it up vs. expectations.

EVA is generally tracked for senior management in large corporations by the project management office (PMO).

### Basic Calculations in Earned Value Analysis

+ CPI = EV / AC   
+ SPI = EV / PV   
+ CV = EV – AC  
+  SV = EV - PV   
+ VAC = BAC – EAC

CPI and SPI greater than 1 is good.  Less than 1 means the project is either tracking over budget or tracking late.

CV, SV, and VAC being positive is good.  This means the project is either being delivered ahead of schedule or under budget.

SPI >1 :smile:

SPI=1 :sweat:

SPI<1 :disappointed:

### EVA Calculation Fence Building Example

You are the project manager to build a fence for a farm.  The farm has 4 sides.  It is expected that each side will take one month to build.  Each side is budgeted to cost $1000. You will build them one at a time.  During project execution you run into a series of risks, some of which turn out to be opportunities.  Your progress is observed to be as follows:

End of month 1:  1 fence built.  Cost is 800.E

800.End of month 2:  1.5 fences built total.  Total cost thus far is  2200

End of month 3:   3.25 fences built total.  Total cost thus far is $3100

A) What are the CV, SV, and calculated CPI,SPI for month 1? month 3?

B) What is the EAC if the CPI can be considered typical moving forward from month 3? What is the VAC?  What are both these values if it is considered atypical and that costs should align with budgets moving forward?

C) In month 3 is the project on schedule?  Is it on budget in month 3?  Will it be at completion?  Plot the project performance.



**Answers:**

A)

month 1:CPI = EV / AC  =   1000/800 =  1.25

SPI = EV / PV  =    1000/1000  =  1.00

CV = EV – AC  =    1000 - 800  =   200

SV = EV – PV  =     1000 - 1000  =  0



month 3:CPI = EV / AC  =   3250/3100 =  1.05

SPI = EV / PV  =    3250/3000  =  1.08

CV = EV – AC  =    3250 - 3100  =   $150

SV = EV – PV  =     3250 - 3000  =  $250  (What does this physically mean?)

B)

EAC = AC + (BAC – EV) / CPI  = 3100 + (4000-3250)/1.05 = $3814

VAC = BAC – EAC = 4000  -  3814  =  $186  (CPI typical in month 3)

EAC = AC + (BAC – EV) = 3100 + (4000-3250)/1.00 = $3850

VAC = BAC – EAC = 4000  -  3850  =  $150  (CPI atypical in month 3)

**C**)

Yes, it is on budget and schedule as far as we can see in month 3.  Both CPI and SPI are 1 or greater in both cases.   And if CPI in month 3 is seen as typical, then we can assume that it will be on time and on budget by project end as well.  Likewise for if it is atypical at CPI=1.  But, if we had been asked the same question regarding our prediction for maintaining both project timing and project budget at completion in month 2, we would have seen a different story..............

#### Application of Earned Value to a Task

Method 1 – As applied earlier in the discussion.  Percentage complete is multiplied by value of the task to determine the earned value thus far.

Method 2 – There is no earned value until the task is complete.  The only two levels of earned value ever applied to a task are $0 or the full value of the activity.

Method 3 – The 50%-50% method.  50% of the value of an activity is assumed earned at the outset of the activity, and 50% of an activity is assumed earned at the completion of an activity.  The advantage here is that method 1 is so tough to predict near the back end of an activity.

All methods are valid.  You can even use a mix in your project so long as you clearly state you are doing so.  Watch for this wrinkle on your tests!

#### Sunk Costs

Sunk costs are non-recoverable costs a project has spent at any time in the project up to the point of its completion.With extremely unsuccessful projects, the temptation is often taken that sunk costs should be considered when additional funding is being considered to fix an unfinished project that requires new funding.  Sunk costs should never be considered in establishing future budgets.  They have no bearing on future earned value, planned value, or actual cost once a new baseline is established.
