float = activity description

slack = duration

Activity network

duration estimate

network diagram

1. length of project (forward path)
2. critical path(backward path) 
3. slack for each activity(backward path) 
4. sensitivity for each branch(backward path) 
5. sensitivity for each activity(backward path) 



backward Path => latest start / End

critical path => largest path => 0 slack time => not most sensitive
