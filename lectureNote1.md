  Convey: （护送）an particular doctors and engineers are seeing the benefit in professional project management in their activities. That can at times mean managing parts of the scientific research that have traditionally been looked at in only the most ad hoc(点对点) manners.

  **What is Project**

  A project is not a process. A project is a collection of tasks organized to have defined start and finish (Be straight discipline) with the purpose of creating a product or service. It is an undertaking that is unique, temporary, and which will be progressively elaborated as it proceeds but which has a pre-defined set of objectives.

  **Objective of Project Management work**

  - First challenge is to make sure that  a project is delivered with defined  constraints.==(Timing, Resources, Money)==
  - second, more ambitious challenge is optimized allocation and integration of inputs needed to meet pre-defined objectives.==(Even very small precentage of optimize could make huge difference)==

  ​

  **triple Constraint**

  The time constraint refers to the amount of time available to complete a project. The cost constraint refers to the budgeted amount available for the project. The scope constraint refers to what must be done to produce the project's end result (and not done).These three constraints are often competing constraints: increased scope typically means increased time and increased cost, a tight time constraint could mean increased costs and reduced scope, and a tight budget could mean increased time and reduced scope.

  **Enterprise Environmental Factors**

  ​

  Enterprise environmental factors refer to both internal and external environmental factors that surround or influence a projects' success.

  ​

  They can arise from any of enterprises involved in the project and are generally an input to most planning processes.

  ​

  Typical enterprise environmental factors include:

  - Organizational culture, structure, and process
  - Infrastructure
  - Company work authorization systems
  - Marketplace conditions
  - Stakeholder risk tolerances
  - Political climate
  - Organization's established communication channels
  - Existing Human resources and personnel administration

**The role of Project Manager**

+ The project manager is the person assigned by the performing organization to achieve the project objectives
+ different from the functional manager or operations manager for an area. Those individuals are focused on management oversight for administrative area or are responsible for  a facet of the core business.
+ In addition to authority by virtue of position, the project manager needs to possess the following characteristics:
   - Knowledge: What the PM knows about project management
   - Performance: What the PM can get done while applying their knowledge
   - Personal: attitude, character, and leadership

---

**Project importance**

+ The product life cycle shortens with improved efficiencies.  Constant innovation is therefore required. Ad hoc（特别的） efforts fail in the face of organized competition (e.g. electronics, automotive)
+ Product launch windows are narrow.  (The concept of selling product A while developing product B)
+ Increasingly complex and technical products. (Consumer demand)
+ Emergence of global markets (Canada these days is more and more a medium tech country often fulfilling the role of integrating the high technology of Germany, Japan and the USA with cost effective labor markets)
+ We are in a sustained economic period of low inflation.  (Low inflation limits corporations from raising prices to increase profits.  The only other option is managing costs) ==Canada inflation rate is among 2.25%, have business with China, India, Mexico

### *Example*:

Company A have 3 field related, Company B have 3 field less related

*Conclusion*: Company A have more continuity project that could help them make more money close to the home base. Use less knowledge to make the same or more money.

**Henry Gantt**  Gantt Graph

**Frederick Winslow Taylor** *The principles of Scientific Management*

## Scientific Management##

Scientific Management is a method in management theory which determines changes to improve labor productivity and its detailed application in the workplace let to - for the first time - application of charts to plan and track projects as workers efforts became standardized.

**Modern Era**

+ CPM (critical path method)
+ PERT chart (Program Evaluation and Review Technique)

## Taylor's Principles of Scientific Management##

- Replace rule-of-thumb work methods with methods based on a scientific study of the tasks. 
- Scientifically select, train, and develop each employee rather than passively leaving them to train themselves. 
- Detailed instruction and supervision of each worker in the performance of that worker's discrete task.
- Divide work nearly equally between managers and workers, so that the managers apply scientific management principles to planning the work and the workers actually perform the tasks

These 4 principles proposed by Taylor standardized the way any employee's work effort could be evaluated.  They paved the way for planning time and resource allocation tool development – Gantt & PERT etc.

**Henry Ford**: using the moving assembly line 

**Frank and Lillian Gilbreths **: continuous quality improvement (CQI)



## *Selected Well Known Scientific Management Concepts*##

**cybernetics**: Its focus is how anything (digital, mechanical or biological) processes information, reacts to information, and changes or can be changed to better accomplish the first two tasks



**Six Sigma** is a set of practices originally developed by Motorola to systematically improve processes by eliminating defects. It asserts that:

1. Continuous efforts to reduce variation in process outputs is key to 	business success. 
2. Manufacturing and business processes can be measured, analyzed, improved and controlled. 
3. Succeeding at achieving sustained quality improvement requires commitment from the   	entire organization, particularly from top-level management 



**Lean Manufacturing:**  Derived from Toyota best practices it is dedicating to reducing waste by now famous methods such as **kanban**, **kaizen**, poke-yoke, usage of just in time automation etc.

## Work Breakdown Structure##

A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a fundamental project management technique for defining and organizing the total scope of a project, using a hierarchical tree structure. 

Also means decompose the whole task at the beginning into small specific pieces .

## Initiating,  Planning, Executing, Controlling, and Closing##

Initiating also in the beginning, defining the task and goal, which use less effort

Planning use more effort 

Closing also means delivering

***Order*** of the Project activity

Communication often lead to unexpected result!

**Polish Conference** is Greatest benefits of formal PM practices identified and summarized in report.

*Example*: two company, one company is closed to the government(***have more trust***), the other is not so close but with other good characteristics(***Risk control in this example, this is a formal manner, they test their fail first and report what would like to be happen before due day***). Owner would like to sign with the second company, the choice also means some tradeoff.

## Project Manager vs. Manager

+ PM’s generally are entry level management positions.
+ Except in highly projectized organizations, PM’s typically do not have “ownership” of the employees they apply.
+ Again except in functional organizations PM’s do not do salary reviews, schedule vacation, or dole out discipline.  This is the job of the manager.
+ Project Managers are typically privy to significant amounts of confidential information, both human resource and financial related.  This is similar to managers financially, but wrt personnel, the access is more tightly controlled.
+ The project manager does more than 90% of the day to day management of the employee typically.  This includes setting priorities for the group and following up on them.

---

## Importance of Project Manager

+ All suppliers, customers, colleagues, sponsors, experts, interested outside influences are project stakeholders and it is the PM’s job to manage all of them.
+ Without total stakeholder satisfaction, the project is measured as a failure.  This is an important distinction, and it explains why the Project Management Institute generally quotes a figure of only 26% of projects being classified as successes.  Certainly in the great majority of cases the good or service was delivered as expected, but due to stakeholder dissatisfaction success cannot be claimed.  Interestingly the figure drops to only 10% for pharmaceutical trial projects.
