## How is a company managed?

+ From the top down in a classical military hierarchy (one person on the top has all the power)
+ Upper Management develops vision statements
+ Middle Management makes mission statements out of that
+ Missions in turn get broken down into Objectives for projects and departments.
+ They are then broken down into Strategies, Goals and Initiatives

GE Vision Statement: 'We bring good things to life'



Mission is distribute several missions(which  always different task) to different VP, then sub divide to small objectives.

## Organizational Structure

### Functional Organization###

**VP**  project expediter and project coordinator

**Strengths and Weaknesses of Functional Organizations**

***Strengths for PM***

+ Projects are developed within the basic functional structure of the organization, requiring no disruption or change of the firm's design
+ Enables the development of in-depth knowledge and intellectual capital
+ Allows for standard career paths. Project team members only perform their duties as needed while maintaining maximum connection with their functional group

***Weaknesses for PM***

+ It is difficult to achieve cross-functional cooperation
+ Lack of customer focus
+ Projects generally take longer to complete due to structural problems, slower 
+ communication, lack of direct ownership of the project, and competing priorities among the functional departments
+ Projects may be sub-optimized due to varying interest or commitment across functional boundaries.

## Project Organizations##

**Strengths and Weaknesses**

+ Assigns authority solely to the PM
+ Leads to improved communication across the organization and among functional groups
+ Promotes effective and speedy decision making
+ Promotes the creation of cadres of PM experts
+ Encourages rapid response to market opportunities

**Weaknesses for PM**

+ Setting up and maintaining teams can be expensive
+ Potential for project team members to develop loyalty to the project rather than the overall organization
+ Difficult to maintain a pooled supply of intellectual capital
+ Concern among project team members about their future once the project ends.

## Matrix Organizations##

**Creating an organization with 2 bosses may seem awkward, but there are important advantages to this approach if certain conditions are met(always some tradeoff):**

+ There is pressure to share scarce resources across product or project opportunities.
+ There is a need to emphasize two or more different types of output. E.g. the company may need to promote it's technical competence (using a functional structure) while continually creating new products (project structure)
+ The environment of the organization is complex and dynamic. When firms face complexity and rapidly changing environmental pressures the matrix organization is flexible to accommodate this change.



the person is borrowed from another department.

For example, vacation and salary part for the home basis, (VP responsibility), day to day work distribute to the PM.



**Strengths and Weaknesses of Matrix Organizations**

***Strengths for PM***

+ Suited to dynamic environments
+ Emphasizes the dual importance of project management and functional efficiency
+ Promotes coordination across functional units
+ Maximizes scarce resources between competing project and functional responsibilities

***Weaknesses for PM***

+ Dual hierarchies mean two bosses
+ Requires significant time to be spent negotiating the sharing of critical 
+ resources between projects and departments
+ Can be frustrating for workers caught between competing project and functional demands

## Stakeholder management##

***Project Stakeholders are defined as:*** Individuals or groups who have an active stake in the project and can potentially impact it's development.



**Identifying Project Stakeholders**:

***Internal***:

+ Management
+ Accountant
+ Team members

***External:***

+ Clients
+ Competitors
+ Suppliers
+ Environmental, political, consumer, and other groups

### Stakeholder Relationships###

**communication paths= n(n-1)/2n= number of communication participants**

for example: 

4 people group : 6 path

6 people : 15 path

8 people: 28 path

even small increase of group can increase the difficulty of communication.

and longer distance communication often cause error message and deviation.

like the passing voice game.

## Organizational Culture

Each organization develops its own unique outlook, operating policies, procedures, patterns of thinking, attitudes, norms of behavior. They are often as unique as a fingerprint. No two organizations no matter how similar in size, products, operating environment, profitability, ... are the same.



Defined as:The solution to external and internal problems that has worked consistently for a group and that is therefore taught to new members as the correct way to perceive, think about and feel in relation to these problems



Eg：Monkey and Banana Story

## Key factors that affect the development of a culture



+ technology 
+ environment 
+ geographical location
+ reward systems
+ rules and procedures 
+ key organizational members
+ critical incidents

## How does Culture Affect Projects?

+ Department interaction

  Cultures favoring cooperation between functional groups and new projects are much more successful than those that adopt a disinterested or even adversarial relationship.

+ Employee commitment to goals

  Projects depend on the commitment and motivation of the team members.

  Team members have to understand the why in order to be motivated.

+ Project planning

  "Padding" of duration estimates when it is not accepted to be late, but to plan poorly

+ Performance evaluation

  When a culture sends the signal that the goal of the firm is to create innovative new products, it reinforces a project management culture that is aggressive and offers potentially high payoffs (and the occasional significant loss!).

high return, high risk

project selection should under the **line**, -- efficient frontier

1. risk should not above the maximum desired risk
2. return should not less than Minimum desired return
