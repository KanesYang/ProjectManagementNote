## Risk management

---

## Project Risk is based this simple equation:

Risk = Probability of event     x      impact of event

---

## Typical ways for the team to come up with their list of risks:

---

## Side Note: Risk and Opportunity(f)

Risk and opportunity are mirror images of unforeseen project events. Opportunity has a positive outcome to the project while risk has adverse effects on the project.

 Opportunities are best handled outside of the Risk Management process. The same methods apply, just for a different outcome.

## Risk Management

Risk Management is a four-stage process:

1. **risk Identification** The process of determining the specific risk factor s that can reasonably be expected to affect your project

2. **Analysis of the probability and consequences** The potential impact of these risk factors, determined by how likely they are to occur and the effect they would have the project if they did occur.

3. **Risk mitigation strategies** Steps taken to minimize the potential impact of those risk factors deemed sufficiently threatening to the project.

4. **Control and Documentation**

   Creating a knowledge base for future projects based on the lessons learned

## Quantitative Risk Analysis

Tools and Techniques for quantitative risk analysis:

1) Data Gathering and Representation techniques

1. Interviewing to quantify the probability and impact of risks on project objectives. The information gathered depends on the circumstance, but most likely will include the optimistic (low), pessimistic (high), and most likely scenarios for the risk event.
2.  Probability distributions can be used to represent uncertain events, such as the outcome of a test.
3.  Expert judgment, experts validate data and techniques.

2) Quantitative Risk Analysis and Modeling Techniques

1. Sensitivity Analysis helps to determine which risks have the most potential impact on the project. It examines the extent to which the uncertainty of each project element affects the objective being examined when all other uncertain elements are held at their baseline values. 
2. **Expected monetary value analysis (EMV) analysis is a statistical concept that calculates the average outcome when the future includes scenarios that may or may not happen. EMV is calculated by multiplying the value of each possible outcome by its probability of occurrence, and adding them together. This is usually done in a decision tree analysis.**
3. **Decision tree analysis is usually structured using a decision tree diagram that describes a situation under consideration and the implications of each of the available choices and possible scenarios.** 
4. Modeling and Simulation. Here the Monte Carlo technique  is typically used, this iterative process is usually performed by a computer that calculates the outcomes of a set of events with the input of randomized values from a probability distribution function. A probability distribution is calculated.

## 3) Risk Mitigation Strategies(f)

The next stage in risk management is the development of effective risk mitigation strategies. There are four possible alternatives a project organization can adopt to address risk:

**train in the execution phase**

+ Accept Risk
+ Minimize Risk
+ Share Risk
+ Transfer Risk
+ Contingency Reserve
+ Other strategies
