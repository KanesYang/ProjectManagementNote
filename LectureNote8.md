### LEED – Definition

LEED stands for Leadership in Environmental and Energy Design.  

Green building design has been around since the time we were in caves.  

You would think that building design would be inherently green, taking into consideration wind and solar loads and designed in a manner to optimize its integration into the climate where it will exist.

However with the advent of heating and AC systems in the 20th century, there was a dramatic shift in the way buildings were designed.

### USGBC – The United States Green Building Council

The mandate of this organization is to register green projects, accept green credit evidence, and advise the credit is either “denied” or “accepted” or “anticipated”.

Their goal is to create buildings that use fewer scarce natural resources, generate less waste, and serve their occupants in a more user friendly manner.

USGBC also certifies “Accredited Professionals” in LEED project development and implementation via the designation LEED AP.
