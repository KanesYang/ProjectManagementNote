### Why do we study Project Management at UWO?

Earlier in the course it might have been mentioned that you study it because only 26% of projects are successful in the business world and that many of them are run by engineers.

A second and equally acceptable answer is that you do it because the other courses in your curriculum are like applications.  This course is like your operating system.  Without a set of operating conditions in which to run your applications, your entire set of calculations will not execute.

### Negotiation – Fundamentals of your Mindset

Separate the people from the problem.  All of us have egos.  All of us have fears and insecurities.  Don't tap into the other guy's.  You will throw both sides of the negotiation out of control.

Stick to business.  Keep the personalities out of it.  This is not the time for a charm offensive.  Nobody will buy it.

Put yourself in their shoes.  Nobody likes to be directly attacked.  This is an extremely ineffective strategy more accurately referred to as counter-productive.

## <u>*Negotiations - Questions*</u>

When entering a negotiation, every negotiator needs to ask 3 questions:

1. How much power do I have?
2. What sort of time pressures are there?
3. Do I trust my opponent?

## Negotiation – Language and Communication

+ When you want to establish your power early in the negotiation:  "I'm sorry, but my colleagues and I cannot settle for that 
+ When you want to invoke the power of legitimacy:     "It doesn't apply in this case."  or "That has never been the standard for this type of application."
+ When you want the other party to state their opening position:     "What are you looking for in these negotiations?"
+ When you want to find out how much authority the other party has:     "Do you have the authority  to commit to that without checking it out at head office?"
+ When you don't want to say no outright for fear of breaking down discussions:     "Let's set that aside for now.  Lets come back to it."

### Resolving Resource Decisions in Multi-project Environments

There are several methods for resolving resource allocation problems:

**"First in Line"** or "first come-first served" is the **simplest rule** of thumb for allocating resources. It is easy to employ, it simply follows the master project calendar. The earliest project gets scheduled first. This method ignores any other important information such as priority, emergency situations, preference due to higher commercial success of other projects. 

**Greatest Resource Demand**

With this decision rule the project with the highest demand of resources get scheduled first. Then the remaining projects are being examined and scheduled according to their level of resource demand. The logic in this method is that in this way the resource bottlenecks will show up very quickly and it is being used as a starting point for potential additional resource allocation.
